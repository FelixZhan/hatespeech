Dataset card for Measuring Hate Speech
This is a public release of the dataset described in Kennedy et al. (2020) and Sachdeva et al. (2022), consisting of 39,565 comments annotated by 7,912 annotators, for 135,556 combined rows. The primary outcome variable is the "hate speech score" but the 10 constituent ordinal labels (sentiment, (dis)respect, insult, humiliation, inferior status, violence, dehumanization, genocide, attack/defense, hate speech benchmark) can also be treated as outcomes. Includes 8 target identity groups (race/ethnicity, religion, national origin/citizenship, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, political ideology) and 42 target identity subgroups, as well as 6 annotator demographics and 40 subgroups. The hate speech score incorporates an IRT adjustment by estimating variation in annotator interpretation of the labeling guidelines.

This dataset card is a work in progress and will be improved over time.
